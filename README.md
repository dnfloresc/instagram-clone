# instagram-clone

My first project using CSS grid. I had a few problems trying to scale my images to the same size as my grid's element.
I finally made it using MQ.

Another problem was that I couldn't put my 'profile-numbers' element in the same place where the official instagram does when it's on 735px screen.

Still have so much to learn.

Hope you like it!
